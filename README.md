## documenting my journey of learning Python (starting 25 FEB 2021)

starting to learn Python **seriously** for the n-th time...

I have some basic knowledge about the fundamentals of programming (loops, variables, functions) before starting this journey.

- robotics
- automate stuffs
- machine learning

> Learning plan (written on 2/25):
- practice on [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) (GOAL: finish before my subscription expires, by August 31, 2021)
- refer official Python documentation
- code at least 30 minutes *EVERY DAY*
- document everything I learnt here
- create some projects by my own

> Free resources:
- [Free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books.md#python)
