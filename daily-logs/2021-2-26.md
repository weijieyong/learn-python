What I learnt:
- lambda function([reference](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp)):
    - syntax: `lambda arguments : expression`
    - can take any number of arguments but only one expression
    - benefits: can use one function to create few different variations
- map() function:
    - syntax: `map(function, iterables)`
    - can have more than one iterables
- memoization
    - storing results in a hash table.. then refer later
