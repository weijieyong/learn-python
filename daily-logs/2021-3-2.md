What I learnt:
- ways to reverse string:
    - use slice.. `reversedString = string[::-1]`
    loop backwards, then use
    - concatenate.. time O(N^2) because need to call the original string every time
    - use join.. time O(N) `"".join()`

- recursion will usually use more space (while waiting for previous results)
    - call stack
    - tail recursive call (not sure what is this)
